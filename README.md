# MotionDetector
Opens and records from the webcam and detects motion, while also noting down the time between motions, and outputting the times
onto an interactive graph.

Changing from the webcam to an external camera is possible too, by changing the value 0 into 1 on the "cv2.VideoCapture(0,....)" line.

NOTE: Outputting onto the graph is still a work in progress!
